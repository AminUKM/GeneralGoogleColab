Each row of these grids corresponds to measurements or values of an instance, while each column is a vector containing data for a specific variable. This means that a data frame’s rows do not need to contain, but can contain, the same type of values: they can be numeric, character, logical, etc.\n","\n","Now, DataFrames in Python are very similar: they come with the <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org\">Pandas</a> library, and they are defined as two-dimensional labeled data structures with columns of potentially different types.\n","\n","In general, you could say that the Pandas DataFrame consists of three main components: the data, the index, and the columns.\n","\n","1. Firstly, the DataFrame can contain data that is:\n","\n","- a Pandas `DataFrame`\n","- a Pandas `Series`: a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type with axis labels or index. An example of a Series object is one column from a DataFrame.\n","- a NumPy `ndarray`, which can be a record or structured\n","- a two-dimensional `ndarray`\n","- dictionaries of one-dimensional `ndarray`'s, lists, dictionaries or Series.\n","\n","**Note** the difference between `np.ndarray` and `np.array()` . The former is an actual data type, while the latter is a function to make arrays from other data structures.\n","\n","Structured arrays allow users to manipulate the data by named fields: in the example below, a structured array of three tuples is created. The first element of each tuple will be called `foo` and will be of type `int`, while the second element will be named `bar` and will be a float.\n","\n","Record arrays, on the other hand, expand the properties of structured arrays. They allow users to access fields of structured arrays by attribute rather than by index. You see below that the `foo` values are accessed in the `r2` record array.- An example:\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BpjOqdf3QLDu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%%capture\n","!pip install -r requirements.txt"],"metadata":{"id":"BYx3GHsrJpFm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729580794575,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4215,"user":{"displayName":"MUHAMMAD AJRUL AMIN BIN MOHD ZAIDI","userId":"03324032608270041025"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PnTjqDd8H23o","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1729580796074,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1503,"user":{"displayName":"MUHAMMAD AJRUL AMIN BIN MOHD ZAIDI","userId":"03324032608270041025"}},"outputId":"10ff30b2-5e0a-44b9-a133-0cfecc32e688"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[1 1 1]\n","[1 1 1]\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# A structured array\n","my_array = np.ones(3, dtype=([('foo', int), ('bar', float)]))\n","# Print the structured array\n","print(my_array['foo'])\n","\n","# A record array\n","my_array2 = my_array.view(np.recarray)\n","# Print the record array\n","print(my_array2.foo)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 1.
